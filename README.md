# PSYC-502-Code
Code repo for PSYC Stats 502

This repository contains R code to help understand concepts from PSYC 502 and to help with homework. It also contains scripts to help with completing homework.

Every homework script calls `helpful_formulas.R`, which contains the formulas needed to complete homework. Many of these formulas are already implemented more
simply in R and various R packages, but the functions in the script help to understand how certain values and statistics are calculated.
